## Introduction

This project was an idea that Chandra had for some code, I have used it for practice on how Classes work, and so I could get to use Jupyter notebooks a bit more.
This code will ask the user how many people are eating at home each evening and then randomly generate a list of dishes for that person to prepare that week. It will then also make a shopping list for them based on the recipes for the dishes

### How it works

In the csv file, add any recipes you want in the format that the current recipes are in. Column one for Recipe name, column two for ingredient name, column three for quantity for unit.
**Each Recipe is based on a meal for 2. If you use acutal recipes, please adjust the quantities accordingly**

In terminal go to the containing folder and type `python3 Chandras_Meal_Project.py` and enjoy a life of never having to put effort into planning your meals ever again.
